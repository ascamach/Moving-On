### Story
One day you, the player, wakes up to find a ghost of your loved one looking at you. They’re stuck in the human/limbo world and need your help to get them to move on into the spirit world. They give you a map and your objective is to go on a journey and put together a key that unlocks the gates of the spirit world for them. On this journey, you’ll encounter levels that correlate to the feelings of grieving.
