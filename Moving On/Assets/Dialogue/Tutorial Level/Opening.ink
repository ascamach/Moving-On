Addison, you’ve been staying in bed for so long. It’s time to get up now. #speaker: Mom 


روح: کله روز تو تختت بودی. وقتشه پاشی


I don’t want to. I just want to be a sad potato and stay here. #speaker: Addison

Come on now, the early bird gets the worm and we’re in a time crunch. I don’t want to fade away. # speaker: Mom

Fine. #speaker: Addison #portrait: player_sad

Why don’t you come with me to the kitchen? You need to eat a good hearty meal before we leave on this journey. #speaker: Mom
