[Mom]: _____, you’ve been staying in bed for so long. It’s time to get up now. 

[Player]: I don’t want to. I just want to be a sad potato and stay here.

[Mom]: Come on now, the early bird gets the worm and we’re in a time crunch. I don’t want to fade away. 

[Player]: Fine.

[Mom]: Why don’t you come with me to the kitchen? You need to eat a good hearty meal before we leave on this journey.
