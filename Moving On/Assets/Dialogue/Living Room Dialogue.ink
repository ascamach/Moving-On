[Addison] I can't stay here anymore. Let's go. 

[Mom] But you're not dressed for the cold outside. You should wear something warmer. My jacket, in my room, will keep you cozy..


[Addison] Do I have to? I think I’ll be fine.

[Mom] We are not stepping out until you put on a proper jacket. Please, fetch it from my room.. Don’t make me have to use my stern voice on you.


[Addison] Alright, I'll go..
