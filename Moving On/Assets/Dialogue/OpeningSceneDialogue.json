No one could see me though except this hooded figure that kept following me. They approached me and said I would be stuck in the land of living. The only way for me to move on from this land is to collect important possessions of mine. This will help me to be able to let go of my old self and accept that I passed on. If I’m unable to find all my possessions, I’ll evaporate into dust and will disappear from the face of this world. The only issue is I can’t touch anything. My hand just goes through everything. I need you to help me get my possessions. Can you help me sweetie? We can spend more time together!","\n","^[Player] If it’s to help you not be stuck in limbo and not disappear, I’ll help you.","\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
